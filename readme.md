# Portfolio Page

### **_Introduction_**
Everyone needs a portfolio page! Here is mine. I have had some portfolio page before - but normally after a few months I don't like them (because of design or content). SO let's see how long this one going to survive me!

### **_Project itself_** 
 Wanted to make a One-page portfolio page to show wome of my skills.

 ### **_Used Technologies_**
 1. HTML
 2. CSS
 3. Tailwind CSS and Tailwind Elements
 4. Animate.css - Animation library
 5. JavaScript

**Aim of the Project**

I chosed to do the page with Tailwind CSS and Tailwind Elements to practice Tailwind more.

Tailwind Elements are really helpful and nice library. It is like Bootstrap 5, with f.e navbar and accordions. But it has already "ready" design block. I love them.

I started to make the page with Tailwind Css and Tailwind Elements, but the project is too small to actually use Tailwind Elements Library. 

So in the end I sticked to Tailwind Css and my own script. I still used some of the design block from Tailwind Elements.

## **_What have I learned_**
Tailwind CSS. PLus sometimes you don't need a full library, when a few line of script can do the same.

## Deployed: 2022. July.
